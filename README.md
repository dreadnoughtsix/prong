# prong
<bold> A clone of PONG. Very buggy, very inefficient, and very glitchy </bold>
This was a Grade 12 project for my Computer Science class. Most of the GUI
were taught by my teacher, but some of the code was self learned. Many problems
persist in this program, such as no implementation (at all) of any garbage
collection (which was apparently an assignment requirement).

How to use:

To compile, use <code> $ javac *.java </code>
To run, use <code> $ java Client </code>
